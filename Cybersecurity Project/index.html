    In today's society, internet safety and data privacy have taken a backseat in people's minds as 
    social media has made sharing online popular, and the internet's free services have lured people to 
    sharing their data freely. This unchecked relationship with online media threatens to produce a 
    generation and culture that prioritizes momentary gratification over a measured and safe approach to
    media.

                <p>
                When I was in elementary school, I remember how we would have a computer class 
                monthly that taught us how to effectively and safely navigate the increasingly 
                advanced technological landscape. By that, I mean that they used a groovy goat 
                avatar in a game to try to teach elementary schoolers how to type and let us 
                spend the rest of the hour drawing shaky houses with the PC Paintbrush. Good 
                times. On a more serious note, the teachers did caution us about being careful 
                never to share our personal information online with strangers. In cyberspace, 
                online safety translates to data privacy since buying and selling data to 
                companies holds tremendous value in today's economy. However, as we can see today,
                 we clearly have not heeded those warnings. So what went wrong?
