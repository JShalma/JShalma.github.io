    In today's society, internet safety and data privacy have taken a backseat in people's minds as 
    social media has made sharing online popular, and the internet's free services have lured people to 
    sharing their data freely. This unchecked relationship with online media threatens to produce a 
    generation and culture that prioritizes momentary gratification over a measured and safe approach to
    media.

                <p>
                Today's generation severely lacks a disciplined approach to being safe online. In cyberspace,
                 online safety translates to data privacy since buying and selling data to companies holds 
                 tremendous value in today's economy.

                    <h1>Human Desire for Connection</h1>
                    <p>
                        Indifference to personal data privacy primarily stems from the human desire for the 
                        connections we form through online platforms like social media. Neil Sahota explores how 
                        humanity’s innate drive for social interactions causes us to sacrifice our digital 
                        privacy. He points out that “we all know (at least subconsciously) that our data is 
                        being taken, mined, and sold…[However, we’re] often copacetic with that because we 
                        get enough value [(social media connections)] out of the systems that we don’t mind 
                        this cost”.

                    <h1>Feelings of Powerlessness</h1>
                    <p>The feeling of powerlessness over personal data has also hindered people’s motivation to 
                        protect themselves online. As technology integrates more into our daily routines, it 
                        feels increasingly difficult to keep our information and data safe. With platforms 
                        like Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, etc, becoming staples in modern-day households,
                         data privacy loss seems inevitable since it’s not possible to live life without these 
                         services. 81% of American adults report experiencing a lack of control over the data 
                         companies collect.

                        <p>
                         Understanding digital privacy laws and your rights on different online platforms is 
                         an important step in protecting your privacy. In places where the law can't protect you,
                         you can take steps to protect yourself by limiting your usage of certain platforms, etc.

                        <p>
                         Take steps to limit unnecessary data sharing. For example, not downloading from random websites, 
                         creating strong and new passwords for your accounts, and not sharing
                         personal information (birthdays, location, etc) are great places to start. 
                         Although these steps can add some inconvenience in our life, this extra mile will help protect you
                         from future disasters.
