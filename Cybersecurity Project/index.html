    In today's society, internet safety and data privacy have taken a backseat in people's minds as 
    social media has made sharing online popular, and the internet's free services have lured people to 
    sharing their data freely. This unchecked relationship with online media threatens to produce a 
    generation and culture that prioritizes momentary gratification over a measured and safe approach to
    media.

                <h1> The Problem </h1>
                <p>
                When I was in elementary school, I remember how we would have a computer class 
                monthly that taught us how to effectively and safely navigate the increasingly 
                advanced technological landscape. By that, I mean that they used a groovy goat 
                avatar in a game to try to teach elementary schoolers how to type and let us 
                spend the rest of the hour drawing shaky houses with the PC Paintbrush. Good 
                times. On a more serious note, the teachers did caution us about being careful 
                never to share our personal information online with strangers. In cyberspace, 
                online safety translates to data privacy since buying and selling data to 
                companies holds tremendous value in today's economy. However, as we can see today,
                 we clearly have not heeded those warnings. So what went wrong?

                    <h2>1.</h2>
                    <h1>Human Desire for Connection</h1>
                    <p>Indifference to personal data privacy primarily stems from the human desire for the connections we form through online platforms like social media. Facebook’s campaign slogan “Connect with Friends and the World Around You” successfully amassed 3.07 billion monthly active users by hijacking this communal drive. In the article “Privacy is Dead And Most People Really Don’t Care”, Neil Sahota explores how humanity’s innate drive for social interactions causes us to sacrifice our digital privacy. He points out that “we all know (at least subconsciously) that our data is being taken, mined, and sold…[However, we’re] often copacetic with that because we get enough value [(social media connections)] out of the systems that we don’t mind this cost” (Sahota). If used conservatively and cautiously, social media’s ability to foster communities beyond the constraints of geography, time, or demographics would be good. However, currently, the dangers of misuse can lead to devastating consequences.</p>

                    <h1>Feelings of Powerlessness</h1>
                    <p>he feeling of powerlessness over personal data has also hindered people’s motivation to protect themselves online. As technology integrates more into our daily routines, it feels increasingly difficult to keep our information and data safe. With platforms like Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, etc, becoming staples in modern-day households, data privacy loss seems inevitable since it’s not possible to live life without these services. A Pew Research Center study found that a “majority of Americans believe their online and offline activities are being tracked and monitored by companies” with 62% of U.S adults who don’t “think it is possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them by companies” (Auxier et al.). Likewise, 81% of American adults report experiencing a lack of control over the data companies collect,  and 63% admit to struggling “to understand the privacy laws that govern use of their data” (Auxier et al.). </p>
