                <h1> The Problem </h1>
                <p>
                In cyberspace,
                 online safety translates to data privacy since buying and selling data to companies holds 
                 tremendous value in today's economy. Today, the data collection industry has multipled and become bigger, and so has the
                 hacking industry. In 2023, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) reported a <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/healthcare-data-breach-statistics/"> 239% escalation </a> in 
                 hacking-related data breaches. Likewise, the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/national-public-data-breach-what-you-need-to-know-843686f7-06e2-4e91-8a3f-ae30b7213535">National Public Data Breach</a> 
                 that occurred in April 2024 impacted an astonishing 2.9 billion records exposing full names, social 
                 security numbers, mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. The <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/press-release/victims-identity-theft-2021"> Bureau of Justice Statistics</a> notes “While about 6 in 10 (59%) victims of identity-theft incidents in 2021 
                 had financial losses of $1 or more, those losses totaled $16.4 billion” which indicates the severity and unpredictability of cyberattacks. In short, data theft could cost 
                 people their finances, reputation, and security. Therefore, protecting our data should be a paramount concern that propels action.

                    <p>
                        Indifference to personal data privacy primarily stems from the human desire for the 
                        connections we form through online platforms like social media. 
                        <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilsahota/2020/10/14/privacy-is-dead-and-most-people-really-dont-care/">Neil Sahota</a>
                        explores how 
                        humanity’s innate drive for social interactions causes us to sacrifice our digital 
                        privacy. He points out that “we all know (at least subconsciously) that our data is 
                        being taken, mined, and sold…[However, we’re] often copacetic with that because we 
                        get enough value [(social media connections)] out of the systems that we don’t mind 
                        this cost”.

                        protect themselves online. As technology integrates more into our daily routines, it 
                        feels increasingly difficult to keep our information and data safe. With platforms 
                        like Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, etc, becoming staples in modern-day households,
                         data privacy loss seems inevitable since it’s not possible to live life without these 
                         services. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">81%</a> 
                         of American adults report experiencing a lack of control over the data 
                         companies collect.
