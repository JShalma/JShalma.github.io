    In today's society, internet safety and data privacy have taken a backseat in people's minds as 
    social media has made sharing online popular, and the internet's free services have lured people to 
    sharing their data freely. This unchecked relationship with online media threatens to produce a 
    generation and culture that prioritizes momentary gratification over a measured and safe approach to
    media.

                <h1> The Problem </h1>
                <p>
                When I was in elementary school, I remember how we would have a computer class 
                monthly that taught us how to effectively and safely navigate the increasingly 
                advanced technological landscape. By that, I mean that they used a groovy goat 
                avatar in a game to try to teach elementary schoolers how to type and let us 
                spend the rest of the hour drawing shaky houses with the PC Paintbrush. Good 
                times. On a more serious note, the teachers did caution us about being careful 
                never to share our personal information online with strangers. In cyberspace, 
                online safety translates to data privacy since buying and selling data to 
                companies holds tremendous value in today's economy. However, as we can see today,
                 we clearly have not heeded those warnings. So what went wrong?

                    <h1>Human Desire for Connection</h1>
                    <p>
                        Indifference to personal data privacy primarily stems from the human desire for the 
                        connections we form through online platforms like social media.Neil Sahota explores how 
                        humanity’s innate drive for social interactions causes us to sacrifice our digital 
                        privacy. He points out that “we all know (at least subconsciously) that our data is 
                        being taken, mined, and sold…[However, we’re] often copacetic with that because we 
                        get enough value [(social media connections)] out of the systems that we don’t mind 
                        this cost”.

                    <h1>Feelings of Powerlessness</h1>
                    <p>The feeling of powerlessness over personal data has also hindered people’s motivation to 
                        protect themselves online. As technology integrates more into our daily routines, it 
                        feels increasingly difficult to keep our information and data safe. With platforms 
                        like Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, etc, becoming staples in modern-day households,
                         data privacy loss seems inevitable since it’s not possible to live life without these 
                         services. 81% of American adults report experiencing a lack of control over the data 
                         companies collect.

                        <p>
                         Understanding digital privacy laws and your rights on different online platforms is 
                         an important step in protecting your privacy. In places where the law can't protect you,
                         you can take steps to protect yourself by limiting your usage of certain platforms, etc.

                        <p>
                         Take steps to limit unnecessary data sharing. For example, not downloading from random websites, 
                         creating strong and new passwords for your accounts, and not sharing
                         personal information (full name, birthdays, location, etc) are great places to start. 
                         Although these steps can add some inconvenience in our life, this extra mile will help protect you
                         from future disasters.

                         help meaningful laws and regulations to be passed in what can be collected by online platform companies.

                        Do your part to inform others about the dangers that lurk in neglecting their data privacy. Data 
                        privacy is (and should be) a universal right. Therefore, the population must be reminded to take 
                        control of their digital footprint.
